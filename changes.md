POSITIONING STRATEGY (Very Important)
Right now you have 5 programs.
But mentally, your structure should be:
Tier 1 - Private Performance Coaching (Core Focus)
Tier 2 - Structured Online Coaching
Tier 3 - Specialized Programs (Nutrition /Yoga)
We are not selling 5 equal programs.
We are selling:
"This is a performance system. Private Coaching is the real experience. Others are structured alternatives."
Subtle difference. Huge impact.
